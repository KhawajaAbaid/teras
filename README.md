# Teras - Tabular Keras

Teras, which is short for "Tabular Keras" implements all the state of the art architectures and layers proposed by researchers, in Keras.
The main purposes of this library are to:
1. Provide a uniform API for all the different proposed architectures by implemeting them in the most intuitive deep learning library Keras.
2. Further bridge the gap between research and application.
