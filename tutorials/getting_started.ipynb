    "Teras (short for Tabular Keras) is a unified deep learning library for Tabular Data that aims to be your one stop for everything related to deep learing with tabular data.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "While these state of the art architectures can be quite sophisticated, Teras, thanks to the increidble design of Keras, abstracts away all the complications and sophistication and makes it easy as ever to access those models and put them to use.\n",

    "1. `teras.layerflow`: It is the LayerFlow API, offering maximum flebility with minimal interface. It's an alternative to the default Parametric API. You can read more about the difference between the two in the Teras APIs section below.\n",
    "2. `teras.layers`: It contains all the layers for all of the architectures offered by Teras.\n",
    "3. `teras.models`: It contains all of the models of all the architectures types, be it Classificaiton, Regresssion etc offered by Teras.\n",
    "4. `teras.generative`: It contains state of the art models for Data Generation. (Currently it offers `CTGAN` and `TVAE`).\n",
    "5. `teras.impute`: It contains state of the art models for Data Imputation. (Currently it offers `GAIN` and `PCGAIN`)\n",
    "6. `teras.preprocessing`: It offers preprocessing classes for data transformation and data sampling that are required by highly sophisticated models specifically the data generation and imputation models.\n",
    "7. `teras.ensemble`: It is a work in progress and aims to offers ensembling techniques making it easier than ever to ensemble your deep learning models, such as using Bagging or Stacking. (Currently it offers very basic version of these.)\n",
    "8. `teras.utils`: It contains useful utility functions making life easier for Teras users\n",
    "9. `teras.losses`: It contains custom losses for various architectures.\n"

    "Teras offers two different APIs for accesing and customizing the models to satiate different levels of accessibility and flexibility needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Parametric API**: It is the default API and something you're already familiar with — you import the model class and specify the values for parameters that determine how the sub layers, models or blocks within the given model are constructed. \n",
    "\n",
    "    For instance, specify the `embedding_dim` parameter during instantiation of `TabTransformerClassifier` and that will be the dimensionality value used to construct/instatiate the `CategoricalFeatureEmbedding` layer. Simple enough, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **LayerFlow API**: It maximizes the flexbility while minimizing the interface. That may sound a bit contradictory at first, but let me explain. Here, instead of specifiy individual parameters specific to sub layers/models, the user instead specifies instances of those sub layers, models or blocks that are used in the given model architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For instance, instead of specifying the `embedding_dim` parameter value, the user specifies an instance of `CategoricalFeatureEmbedding` layer. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    Now in this instance, we're just passing one parameter instead of another so it may not seem like much beneficial at first glance but let me highlight how it can immensely help depending on your use case:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Since all you need to pass is an instance of layer, it can be any layer, there's no resitriction that it must be instance of `CategoricalFeatureEmbedding` layer — which means that you get complete control over not just customizing the existing layers offered by Teras but also you can design/create an Embedding layer of your own that can work in the place of the original  `CategoricalFeatureEmbedding` layer or any other layer for that matter. This is especially useful, if you're a desinging a new architecture and want to rapidly test out new modifications of the existing architectures by just plugging certain custom layers of your own in place of the default ones. Pretty cool, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. In many cases, to reduce the plethora of parameters and keep the most important ones, some parameters specific to sub-layers, models are not offered at the top level of the given architecture by the Parametric API, so if you need to tweak those parameters missing from the main model, you can use LayerFlow API and create an instance of that layer/model with desired parameters and pass it to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Now, some of you mega smart minded ones, might be thinking, what if there was a way to pass instances of certain layers but also just specify some parameter value for other layers and leave it to `Teras` to instantiate those layers, well I'm just like you fr and you can do just that with the LayerFlow API. Even though, the parameters specific to layers aren't inlcuded in the documentation of the LayerFlow version of those layers/models, but you can specify any parameter that is offered by the **Parametric API** in the **LayerFlow API** version of the model.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    For instance, say we just want to pass an instance of our custom Categorical Embedding layer but instead of specify an instance of the `Encoder` layer, we just want to modify the `dropout rate` for the `FeedForward` layer within it. Well since we know that the `TabTransformerClassifier`'s `Parametric` version exposes a `feed_forward_dropout` parameter, we can pass that keyword argument in the `LayerFlow` verson of the `TabTransformerClassifier`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here's how you'd do it in the code:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    from teras.layerflow.models import TabTransformerClassifier\n",
    "\n",
    "    custom_categorical_embedding = CustomCategoricalFeatureEmbedding()\n",
    "\n",
    "    model = TabTransformerClassifier(categorical_feature_emebdding=custom_categorical_embedding,\n",
    "                                    feed_forward_dropout=0.5)\n",
    "    ```\n",
