Generative
========================

Teras generative module provides an easy and convenient way of accessing generative models offered by Teras.

.. admonition:: Note!

   The code files for those models and their layers actually exist in the `teras/models` and `teras/layers`
   directories respectively.

Here are quick links to the documentation of the generative models and layers offered by Teras.
