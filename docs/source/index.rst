teras - your onestop for deep learning for tabular data!
=====

Hello, world! Welcome to the documentation of teras.

teras (short for Tabular Keras) is a unified deep learning library for
Tabular Data that aims to be your one stop for everything related to deep
learing with tabular data.

.. note::
   **teras v0.3 is now fully based on Keras 3, making everything available
   backend agnostic. It supports TensorFlow, JAX and PyTorch backends.**

teras provides state of the art layers, models and architectures for all
purposes, be it classification, regression or even data generation and
imputation using state of the art deep learning architectures.

It also includes functions and classes for preprocessing data for complex
architectures, making it extremely simple to transform your data in the
expected format, saving you loads of hassle and time!

While these state of the art architectures can be quite sophisticated, Teras,
thanks to the incredible design of Keras, abstracts away all the complications
and sophistication and makes it easy as ever to access those models and put them
to use.

Not only that, everything available is highly customizable and modular, allowing
for all variety of use cases.
