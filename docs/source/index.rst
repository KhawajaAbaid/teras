Hello, world! Welcome to the documentation of Teras.

Teras (short for Tabular Keras) is a unified deep learning library for Tabular Data that aims to be your one stop for everything related to deep learing with tabular data.

It provides state of the art layers, models and architectures for all purposes, be it classification, regression or even data generation and imputation using state of the art deep learning architectures.

It also includes Preprocessing, Encoding and (Categorical and Numerical) Embedding layers.

While these state of the art architectures can be quite sophisticated, Teras, thanks to the incredible design of Keras, abstracts away all the complications and sophistication and makes it easy as ever to access those models and put them to use.

Not only that, everything available is highly customizable and modular, allowing for all variety of use cases.
