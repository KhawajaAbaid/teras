PCGAIN Layers
===============


.. admonition:: Note!

   PCGAIN's layers are atomic — they don't build on sub-layers — hence their `LayerFlow` version is the same as their
   `Parametric` version. The code for PCGAIN layers exist in the ``teras.layers.pcgain``, but Teras allows you to
   access them ``teras.layerflow.layers`` for convenience sake.

Here are quick links to the documentation of the PCGAIN layers.
