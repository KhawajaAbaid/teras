Impute
======================

Teras `impute` module provides an easy and convenient way of accessing imputation models offered by Teras.

.. admonition:: Note!

   The code files for those models and their layers actually exist in the ``teras/models`` and ``teras/layers``
   directories respectively.

Here are quick links to the documentation of the imputation models and their layers offered by Teras.
