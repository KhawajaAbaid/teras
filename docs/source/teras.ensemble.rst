Ensemble
======================

Teras ``ensemble`` module aims to provide ensembling techniques like ``Stacking`` and ``Bagging``, to make it a breeze to
create ensembles of your deep learning models.

.. admonition:: Important Note!

   This module is a work in progress, and currently it only provides very basic versions of ``Bagging`` and ``Stacking``.
